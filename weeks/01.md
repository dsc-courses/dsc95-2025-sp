## üìñ Readings

- [So You Think You Can TA by John Kohler](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15roVBW_Tj3o-qvzt77lvcDmdly0WaZ6GRP_bRh61qAE/edit). This guide was written with TAs who run discussion sections in mind, but many of the tips (e.g. following up with students when you don't know something, bending down or sitting in a chair to maintain eye-level contact with them) are relevant in office hours too.
- [The Tao Of TALC](https://cs375.github.io/su22/resources/talc.pdf). This guide describes how to effectively run large-scale office hours that are not unlike our DSC office hours, especially when things get busy. Not everything will directly apply, especially in more theoretical courses, but it's still useful to read.
