## üìñ Readings

- [DSC 10 Beta-Testing Guide](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc10-wiki/wiki/Beta-testing-assignments): it won't all be relevant for your Final Project, but it'll give you an idea of the kinds of things to watch for.
- [Active Learning in the College Classroom](https://www.calstatela.edu/dept/chem/chem2/Active/main.htm). Good in general, but can also help you design your Final Project.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Homework (due Sunday, May 21st)

Coming soon!

<!-- A checkpoint (i.e. rough draft) for your Final Project is due on Sunday. Submit it [here](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/527891/assignments/2879666) on Gradescope. 
- If your Final Project is a website, poster, write-up, etc, submit a PDF of your draft.
- If your Final Project is a video, submit an unlisted YouTube link of your draft.

Next week, you'll have to give feedback on other students' checkpoints ‚Äì more details to come.

This is your only homework for the week. -->
