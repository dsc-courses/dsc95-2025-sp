## ‚úçÔ∏è Homework (Part 1 due on Friday, April 21st; Part 2 due on Sunday, April 23rd)

<!-- [Submit your answers on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/527891/assignments/2812749/){: .btn .btn-purple } -->

**Don't forget that [Homework 2](../02) is also due on Sunday.**

There are two parts to Homework 3:

### Part 1: Questions for Experienced Tutors (due on Friday, April 21st)

Our upcoming class will mostly be a panel led by experienced tutors. Specifically, we'll have:

- Quentin Callahan (DSC 20, 30)
- Oren Ciolli (DSC 10, 40A, 40B)
- Charisse Hao (DSC 10, 20)
- Weiyue Li (DSC 20, 30, 40A, 40B, 80)
- Harshi Saha (DSC 10, 40A)

We'll have an open-ended period at the end of the panel where you can ask questions of the panelists. However, to ensure our discussion time is used wisely, we'd like you to submit **two questions** that you'd like to hear the panelists answer. Your questions can be directed at all of the panelists, or at a specific panelist.

Submit your two questions [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_AGRICtkQvXTM-YA4uccg2f__FsL4CvMJELAvI7UrOQLxlA/viewform) by **Friday**. This is earlier than the normal homework deadline since the panelists need time to read and prepare for your questions.

### Part 2: Completing the Week 3 In-Class Worksheet (due on Sunday, April 23rd)

Fully complete the [**In-Class Worksheet**](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/527891/assignments/2827675) that we didn't get a chance to discuss in Monday's class. We'll take up everyone's answers when we meet again, and continue a discussion on grading.
