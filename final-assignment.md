The Final Assignment in this class consists of two tasks detailed below.

### Task 1: Create a Mock Resume Section Regarding Tutoring

Tutoring experience can be a highlight of a resume in job hunting. Please create a mock section for your resume regarding tutoring. As you create the section, please think about and elaborate on the following aspects. Feel free to include details, numbers, and evidence.   But remember this is just one part of your one-page resume, so keep it brief!

- What skills have you learned or developed while tutoring?
- What is the highlight of your tutoring experience? 
- What tasks did you do? 
- What skills and knowledge did you apply while tutoring?
- What makes YOU a unique tutor?  What did you do that really stands out? 

### Task 2: Create a Mock Elevator Pitch Regarding Tutoring

An elevator pitch is a short description of your background and experience that introduces yourself to career and business connections in a compelling way. It is called elevator pitch because you should be able to present it during a short period of time, like an elevator ride. 
Please write a sample elevator pitch (150-250 words) emphasizing you tutoring experience. There are a list of information that you may need in your elevator pitch: 
- Who are you?
- What do you do? (emphasizing you tutoring experience)
- What do you want?
- Why should the person you are talking to care?

Submit the answers for both tasks to Gradescope under HW8.
