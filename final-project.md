# ðŸŽ¨ Final Project Guidelines
{:.no_toc}

The Final Project in this class is to produce an instructional video related to the class you are tutoring for.

There are two goals for this:
- The video should benefit students in the class youâ€™re tutoring for.
- The process of creating the video will help you learn about how to create instructional materials.

You will create your video **individually**.Â You will be assigned a tutor who will be a resource to guide you through the process.

There are three checkpoints, followed by a final deadline.

### Submit your final project to [**this Google Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScD4Na6WiCNhRaMGFgAtZcia5UEr792cXA6eUDtKPDKDXbFXA/viewform).

### First Checkpoint, due Tuesday, April 30th

By Tuesday, April 30th at 11:59PM, you should:

1. Read this document.
2. Brainstorm a list of topics that your video might cover.Â  You should come up with at least two on your own, and then share your list with the other tutors in DSC 95 for your class (which you can do in your class-specific channel on Slack).
3. Schedule and complete a meeting with your assigned tutor (reach out via Slack), and talk through which topics might be best.

Deciding on a good topic is hard! Some considerations include:
- **Scope**: It can be hard to pick the right amount of material to cover in an instructional video.Â  You want the topic to be narrow enough to cover the material in depth, but not so specific that they donâ€™t help students learn general concepts.
- **Level**: Do you want to target your video specifically to beginning or struggling students, or make the material more broadly applicable to all students in the class?
- **Complementary**: The material should be closely related to the material covered in class, but should not be a direct repeat of the material in lectures, readings, or assignments.

You might notice that there is some tension between these goals.Â That is one of the fun aspects of teaching!

### Second Checkpoint, due Tuesday, May 14th

By Tuesday, May 14th at 11:59PM, you should:

1. **Read** [this article](https://cteresources.bc.edu/documentation/learning-objectives) on learning objectives.
1. **Think about** how you may apply the concepts from the article to the class that you are currently tutoring. Try to talk to your class' professor and **discuss** what you come up with if the professor is available.Â 
1. **Finalize** your topic.

You'll submit your topic and learning goals to Gradescope.

### Third Checkpoint, due Tuesday, May 21st

By Tuesday, May 21st at 11:59PM, you should **create and submit** a video outline:

1. This can be a word-for-word **script** of what you want to say or a detailed **outline** of how you want to structure your video. Depending on the length of your video, these should be around 250-1000 words.
1. Your outline or script should be organized in a manner that **aligns** with the **learning goals and objectives** you created in the second checkpoint!

You'll submit your outline to Gradescope.

### Final Submission, due Tuesday, June 4th

By Tuesday, June 4th at 11:59PM, you should:

1. **Record** your instructional video material.
   1. This should take multiple tries. We want the video to be **clean and concise**, if possible.
   2. Perform multiple takes of complicated scenes.
   3. Consider including your webcam to appear more friendly.
   4. Basic screen recording can be done with Zoom. More advanced recording can be done with OBS (Mac/Windows). Suraj personally uses [Loom](https://loom.com), which he highly recommends.
   5. Try to portion your video into multiple parts, where each team member records a part.
2. **Edit** your video (aim for between 5-10 minutes).
   1. MacOS has iMovie, and Windows 11 has ClipChamp. These are basic editors that will allow you to cut out mistakes in your recording.
   2. **Send a draft of your video to your assigned tutor, ideally by Tuesday, May 28th. They will provide any necessary feedback.**
3. **Upload** your video to YouTube (it can be unlisted).

You'll submit your video URL to the form below.

**You really should plan to record multiple drafts of your video, and send them to your assigned tutor and/or Suraj for feedback. It takes lots of practice to be able to record high quality vidoes!**
