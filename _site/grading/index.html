A rubric isnâ€™t provided for you â€“ youâ€™ll have to create it yourself. To submit your work, answer the questions in the Gradescope form below.</p><p><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/759123/assignments/4407023/" class="btn btn-purple">Submit here by Tuesday, April 30th</a></p><p>You may wonder why youâ€™re being asked to grade a math problem despite not tutoring for DSC 40A or DSC 40B. The answer is that the process of creating a rubric is quite similar regardless of the medium!</p><hr /><p>Suppose youâ€™re operating a fruit stand near La Jolla Cove. Your stand only accepts cash, so you donâ€™t have access to digital receipts of all of your transactions.</p><p><strong>Part A (4 points)</strong></p><p>You want to keep track of the mean transaction price so far during the day. Instead of writing down the price of each transaction and re-calculating the mean every time someone makes a purchase, you want to come up with a way to only keep track of the mean transaction price. Let \(x_i\) represent the price of the \(i\)th transaction (e.g. the 5th transaction of the day is \(x_5\)). We define \(\mu_n\) to be the mean of the first \(n\) transactions; that is, \(\mu_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\).</p><p>Determine a formula for \(\mu_{n+1}\) that only uses the variables \(\mu_n\), \(n\), and \(x_{n+1}\). (Hint: Start by writing out the definition of \(\mu_{n+1}\).)</p><p><strong>Part B (1 point)</strong></p><p>Why does the above result imply that you donâ€™t need to store the values of all transactions individually?</p><p><strong>Part C (2 points)</strong></p><p>So far, youâ€™ve sold 7 items and the mean transaction price (including the 7th item) is $12. How much would your <strong>next</strong> transaction price have to be in order for your new mean transaction price to be $14?</p><hr /><p>Weâ€™re not going to provide you with the solution or the rubric (though feel free to message on Slack if youâ€™re unsure of the answer). What we have provided you with below are three (real) student solutions to all three parts. Your job is to create a rubric for all three parts and score all three submissions using your rubric. Specific formatting details are provided in the Gradescope submission form.</p><p>When crafting your rubric, you should assume that students are required to show their work, and not just provide an answer.</p><details> <summary>Student submission 1</summary> <center><img src="https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc95-2023-sp/weeks/images/student-1.png" width="50%" /></center> </details> <details> <summary>Student submission 2</summary> <center><img src="https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc95-2023-sp/weeks/images/student-2.png" width="50%" /></center> </details> <details> <summary>Student submission 3</summary> <center><img src="https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc95-2023-sp/weeks/images/student-3.png" width="50%" /></center> </details></div></div>
